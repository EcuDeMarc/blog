The determinants of house prices are:

1. Average earnings
2. Mortgage interest rate

## Average earnings

We can have a look at the evolution of average earnings in the UK since January 2000 up to June 2021.

The above figure is plotting the [seasonally adjusted KAB9 series](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/timeseries/kab9/lms) compiled by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

As we can see, there has been steady growth in the average weekly earnings of the average British worker.

## Mortgage interest rate

As we have seen in the post on [House Prices and Interest Rates]({{<relref "house-prices-interest-rates">}}), there is a definite and mechanical relationship between interest rates and house prices.

We show below the evolution of mortgage interest rates in the UK since January 2000 up to July 2021.

The above figure is plotting the [IUMBV34 series](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/database/fromshowcolumns.asp?Travel=NIxAZxSUx&FromSeries=1&ToSeries=50&DAT=RNG&FD=1&FM=Jan&FY=2000&TD=31&TM=Dec&TY=2025&FNY=Y&CSVF=TT&html.x=66&html.y=26&SeriesCodes=IUMBV34&UsingCodes=Y&Filter=N&title=IUMBV34&VPD=Y#) compiled by the Bank of England.

As we can see, there has been a rapid fall in the mortgage interest rates offered in the UK.

This means that since January 2000, it has got cheaper to borrow to fund the purchase of real estate assets.

## House prices

We now have a look at how the average house price has changed in the UK since January 2000.

The image above is showing a plot produced by using [Land Registry House Price Index series](https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ukhpi/download/new.csv?from=2000-01-01&to=2021-06-01&location=http%3A%2F%2Flandregistry.data.gov.uk%2Fid%2Fregion%2Funited-kingdom&thm%5B%5D=property_type&in%5B%5D=avg)

As you can see from the plot above, the average house price in the UK has gone up from £75K in 2000 to £265K in June 2021.

## Predicted House Prices

We can use the earnings and interest figures to predict house prices.

We make the assumption that renters are willing to pay 33% of their earnings in rent.
