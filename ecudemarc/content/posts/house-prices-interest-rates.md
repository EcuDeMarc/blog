What is the relationship between house prices and interest rates?

In this post, we try to explain this relationship.

Let us start with one simple example.

## Example 1

Let us assume we own a property which, if rented out, can achieve an annual rental income of 12,000.

Furthermore, let us assume that the prevailing interest rate at the time on debt is 8% per annum.

To fund the purchase of said property, we need equity on top of debt. We already know the cost of debt of 8% per annum. What is the cost of equity? Usually, we can say that the cost of equity is 5 percentage points greater than the cost of debt. Thus, the cost of equity is 8% + 5% = 13%.

Thus, we have the following cost of debt and equity to fund the purchase:

* Cost of debt: 8% per annum
* Cost of equity: 13% per annum

The cost of equity has to be higher than the cost of debt since equity owners are taking on more risk than debt owners.

We decide to fund the purchase of the house with 60% debt and 40% equity.

Given the above funding scheme, what is the overall cost of capital to fund the purchase? We can calculate this in the following manner:

```
Cost of debt * % Debt in capital + Cost of equity * % Equity in capital = Cost of capital
```

```
8% * 60% + 13% * 40% = 10%
```

Thus, we conclude that the cost of capital is 10% per annum.

Once we know the cost of capital, we can calculate the fair value of the property by dividing the annual rental income by the cost of capital.

```
12,000/10% = 120,000
```

Thus, with a cost of capital of 10%, the fair value of this property is 120,000.

## Example 2

Now, let us assume we still own the property able to achieve an annual rental income of 12,000.

But now the cost of debt is 1% (no longer 8%).

Would the fair value of the property change?

The answer is yes, let us see why.

Firtsly, we need to calculate the cost of equity which is:

```
1% + 5% = 6%
```

Remember that we have to apply a 5% spread on top of the cost of debt to compensate for the risks that equity owners have vis-Ã -vis debt owners.

Thus, we have the following cost of debt and equity to fund the purchase:

* Cost of debt: 1% per annum
* Cost of equity: 6% per annum

Note that the cost of debt has gone down dramatically. The same applies to the cost of equity. Thus, one can conclude that it has become cheaper to fund the purchase of this house.

As in the previous example, we decide to fund the purchase of the house with 60% debt and 40% equity.

Given the above funding scheme, what is the overall cost of capital to fund the purchase? We can calculate this in the following manner:

```
Cost of debt * % Debt in capital + Cost of equity * % Equity in capital = Cost of capital
```

```
1% * 60% + 6% * 40% = 3%
```

The overall cost of capital is 3% per annum (no longer 10% per annum as in the previous example).

Once we know the cost of capital, we can calculate the fair value of the property by dividing the annual rental income by the cost of capital.

```
12,000/3% = 400,000
```

Thus, with a cost of capital of 3%, the fair value of this property is 400,000.

## Conclusion

We can see that by lowering interest rates from 8% to 1%, the price of our property has shot up from 120,000 to 400,000. For this price change to occurr you don't need to have an increase in the rental income.
